# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the Store Inspector application from a monolithic 2461-line `server.js` file into a clean, modular architecture.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Directory Structure

```
store-inspector/
├── middleware/          # NEW - Authentication & upload middleware
│   ├── auth.js         # requireAdmin, requireAuth, logSession
│   └── upload.js       # Multer file upload configuration
├── services/           # NEW - Business logic services
│   ├── dataLoader.js   # Data loading & caching
│   └── mcpCompliance.js # MCP visit plan compliance
├── routes/             # NEW - Route handlers
│   ├── auth.js         # Authentication routes
│   ├── data.js         # Stores & categories routes
│   ├── submissions.js  # Submission CRUD routes
│   ├── history.js      # User history route
│   ├── adminUsers.js   # Admin user management
│   ├── adminCategories.js # Admin category management
│   ├── adminTemplates.js  # Template upload/download
│   └── adminExport.js     # Excel & PowerPoint export
└── server-refactored.js   # NEW - Clean server file (116 lines)

- Services can be extended independently
- Middleware can be reused across routes

### 3. **Testability** 🧪
- Each module can be unit tested
- Mock dependencies easily
- Clear input/output contracts

### 4. **Readability** 📖
- Self-documenting file structure
- Consistent patterns across modules
- Better code discoverability

### 5. **Collaboration** 👥
- Multiple developers can work in parallel
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Easier code reviews

## Next Steps to Use the Refactored Code

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)

Test the refactored server first:

```bash
# Start refactored server on port 3000
node server-refactored.js
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and test:
- ✅ Login with existing credentials
- ✅ Store selection and submission
- ✅ Image upload
- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ Template upload/download
- ✅ Export to Excel/PowerPoint

### Option 2: Replace Original

Once testing is complete:

```bash
# Backup original
mv server.js server-backup.js

# Use refactored version
mv server-refactored.js server.js

# Start normally
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Run Both (Testing)

Keep both and compare:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Original (port 3000)
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Refactored (change PORT in .env or code to 3001)
PORT=3001 node server-refactored.js
```

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the refactored application:

### Authentication & Session
- [ ] Admin login
- [ ] TDL login

- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Session persistence across page reloads

### Field User Features
- [ ] View assigned stores (filtered by role)
- [ ] Submit "before" inspection (with images)
- [ ] Submit "after" inspection (with fixes)
- [ ] View submission history
- [ ] Upload images from camera/gallery

### Admin Features
- [ ] View all submissions (with filters)

- [ ] Bulk delete submissions
- [ ] Create/edit/delete users
- [ ] Reset user password
- [ ] Toggle user status (active/inactive)

- [ ] Upload categories template
- [ ] Upload users template
- [ ] Upload MCP visit plan
- [ ] Download templates
- [ ] Export to Excel (with filters)
- [ ] Export to PowerPoint (with images)

- [ ] In-memory cache works
- [ ] MongoDB synchronization
- [ ] CSV fallback (if MongoDB fails)
- [ ] S3 image upload

- [ ] Vietnamese text rendering

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### ⚠️ Issue: "Cannot find module './routes/xxx'"
**Solution:** Ensure all route files are in the `routes/` directory and named correctly.

### ⚠️ Issue: "requireAdmin is not a function"
**Solution:** Check that middleware is properly imported in route files.

### ⚠️ Issue: "getData is not defined"
**Solution:** Import `getData` from `services/dataLoader` in route files.

### ⚠️ Issue: Routes return 404
**Solution:** Check that routes are mounted with correct paths in server-refactored.js.

### ⚠️ Issue: Session not persisting
**Solution:** Verify session middleware is configured before routes in server file.

## Performance Impact

**Expected:** No performance degradation
- Same number of database queries
- Same in-memory caching strategy
- Same middleware stack
- Only code organization changed

**Actual:** Potential improvements
- Better code splitting for Node.js module caching
- Clearer dependency management
- Easier to optimize individual modules

## Code Quality Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- Files: 1
